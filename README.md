Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to review Amazon's written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.


## How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
Base on my calculations there were 61139 number of reviews.

## many Vine reviews were 5 stars? 

213 reviews were 5 stars

## How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
28839 non-Vine reviews were 5 stars

## What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

 0.0034838646363205155  were 5 stars. and 0.471695644351396 or 47%

## Summary: 
Looking at my statistics I would consider there to be a negative bias tours 5 stars. I would say that the numbers point to that there are less people reviews with 5 stars review than those who are less than 5 stars review. 
Another analysis that could help Amazon would be possible analysis that could be looking at customers customers rating and deterine what drives them to put a star less than 5. This would help know what things can be done to make the ratings higher.
